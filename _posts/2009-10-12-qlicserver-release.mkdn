title: Updated flex-grid - Release 2009-10-12
tags: [gridengine, flexlm]

A new version of my FlexLM / GridEngine integration has been released. The
version 2009-10-12 supersede previous releases. It is primarily a bugfix
version (triad handling), with other minor improvements.

The download files formerly known as **qlicserver** can now be found as a
more generic **flex-grid**. The name change reflects the fact that it might
also be a useful place to bundle other miscellaneous flexible
gridengine-related scripts.

For redundancy and simplicity, I've also converted the various releases into
a git repository, which is currently hosted at github. <br/>

This has the advantage of making it easier for the end-user to track the
changes between releases, or between their own version and the released
version. It also provides a convenient means of browsing the repository
files and even just grabbing a single file (for people in a hurry). For
example,

        wget http://github.com/olesenm/flex-grid/raw/master/site/qlicserver

The changes to the code itself are listed on the project page:

The latest release (flex-grid-20091012.tar.gz) is also available on the

        http://gridengine.sunsource.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList

But it can also be downloaded as a zip or tar file from the github
repository directly.
