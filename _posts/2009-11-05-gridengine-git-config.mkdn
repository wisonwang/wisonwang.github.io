title: Keeping GridEngine configuration information in git
tags: [gridengine, git]

If indeed "imitation is the highest form of flattery", then
[Edward Dale](http://scompt.com) should indeed be flattered
since I've taken his idea about
[Keeping Grid Engine configuration information in Subversion](http://scompt.com/blog/archives/2009/10/13/versioned-grid-engine-configuration)
that I noticed thanks to [Chris' blog entry](http://gridengine.info/2009/10/19/tracking-rollback-of-sge-config-changes)
and simply used [git](http://git-scm.org) for the backend storage.

After seeing the simplicity of the solution and its usefulness, it looked to
be a *must have*, except that I generally use git for almost everything and
adding subversion to the mix would be annoying. The crux point thus seemed
to be replacing `svn_load_dirs.pl` (to import and update everything) with an
equivalent `git-load-dirs`. Unfortunately, `git-load-dirs` would
make the script dependent on a number of additional python modules.

Luckily, every now and then it pays to *RTFM* instead of just searching
everywhere in the internet for a solution. Using `git --help` or `man git`
reveals two obviously useful command-line options:

    --git-dir=<path>
        Set the path to the repository. This can also be controlled by
        setting the GIT_DIR environment variable...

    --work-tree=<path>
        Set the path to the working tree... This can also be controlled by
        setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable...

The resulting
[GridEngine-git-config](http://github.com/olesenm/flex-grid/blob/master/scripts/GridEngine-git-config)
script is now part of the
[programs](http://olesenm.github.io/flex-grid/programs.html) in
[flex-grid](http://olesenm.github.io/flex-grid/).

In the current long form it adds various error checking and intelligence to
avoid creating unnecessary snapshots, but stripped of all that it essentially
boils down to this:

{% highlight sh %}
#!/bin/sh
# configuration variables
SGE_ROOT=/opt/grid
SGE_CELL=default
GIT_DIR=/some/share/git-repo/gridengine-config.git
export SGE_ROOT SGE_CELL GIT_DIR

# GridEngine settings
. $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/settings.sh

# Create a fresh empty directory
tmpDir=$(mktemp -d)
trap "rm -rf $tmpDir 2>/dev/null; exit 0" EXIT TERM INT

$SGE_ROOT/util/upgrade_modules/save_sge_config.sh $GIT_WORK_TREE

(
    cd $tmpDir || exit 1
    GIT_WORK_TREE=.; export GIT_WORK_TREE

    # use backup_date for the commit message
    msg=$(cat backup_date)

    # various cleanup of files, contents etc.
    # see full version for the detailed implementation
    needsCommit=true

    if [ "$needsCommit" = true ]
    then
        # register all new files
        git add .

        # commit everything
        git commit -a -m "$msg"
    else
        echo "no changes to be committed $msg"
    fi
)
{% endhighlight %}


Stripped down to the essentials, the `svn_load_dirs.pl` has been replaced by
the tandem

    git add .

and

    git commit -a

both of which only rely on git being installed.


For convenience, the GridEngine-git-config script provides a pass-through
for some common git commands:
- *GridEngine-git-config*  ***log***
- *GridEngine-git-config*  ***ls-files***
- *GridEngine-git-config*  ***show***
- *GridEngine-git-config*  ***whatchanged***

Under normal circumstances, the ***show*** and ***whatchanged*** would be
the most useful means of seeing which changes have occurred.

The `git instaweb` or the `gitweb.cgi` can also be used to browse the
changes.
