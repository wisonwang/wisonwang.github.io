### This site ###{: class="vlist"}

Born out of necessity (to get github project pages working), I figured
blogging may even prove a useful means of noting things that would otherwise
get buried in mailing lists.

### About me ###{: class="vlist"}

My background is in [Computational Fluid
Dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics).

I am well-versed in Perl, which I consider an excellent tool for data
munging and for a variety of other tasks. Since starting to use OpenFOAM for
CFD calculations a few years ago, I have also upgraded my C++ skills to
match. As a further outcome of practicing CFD, which generally requires
parallel processing to achieve acceptable run-times, I continue to
reconfigure and maintain a Linux cluster using GridEngine as the resource
management (queuing) system.

As a side-note, I maintained and enhanced an orphaned
[rxvt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rxvt) many years ago when my
underpowered workstation found XTerm to be a memory hog.
